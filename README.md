# ROR Cards – Colregs Cards

Welcome to a repository for ROR Cards – Rules of the Road cards designed specifically for merchant navy professionals and students preparing for the 2nd mates course. These flashcards are an invaluable tool for mastering maritime collision avoidance rules as per the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs).

## About ROR Cards

ROR Cards are educational tools that simulate real-life maritime scenarios. Each card displays the view from the deck of different types of vessels such as powerboats, sailing ships, and fishing vessels. These visuals represent various developing traffic situations at sea, challenging the mariner to decide the correct course of action to safely navigate through potential hazards.

The reverse side of each card provides the correct navigational actions to take and cites the specific COLREG rule applicable to the situation. This dual-sided approach ensures that learners not only test their knowledge but also reinforce correct responses aligned with international maritime laws.

## Key Features

- **Visual Learning:** Each card features a realistic scenario viewed from a vessel, aiding in visual memory retention and practical understanding.
- **Rule References:** Direct citation of relevant COLREG rules on the reverse side of each card helps in linking practical decisions with theoretical knowledge.
- **Diverse Scenarios:** Includes a wide range of maritime situations involving different vessel types to cover comprehensive navigational challenges.
- **Interactive Flashcard System:** Integrates with a modern flashcard application to enable spaced repetition and confidence tracking, enhancing the learning process.
